# 👋 Hi, I'm Om Hande 🔐📊  
### Cybersecurity | GRC | IT Auditing | Risk & Compliance

🚀 I live at the intersection of **security, risk, and governance** — where controls meet code and compliance meets reality.

---

## 🧠 What I Do
- 🔍 **Cybersecurity Audits & Assessments**  
  (PCI DSS, ISO/IEC 27001, NIST, ITGC)
- 🧩 **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)**  
  Turning frameworks into **practical, auditable implementations**
- 🛡️ **Risk Management & Control Design**  
  Identifying gaps, assessing impact, and designing **real-world controls**
- 🧪 **Security Operations & Technical Controls**  
  Firewalls, WAF, IDS/IPS, Vulnerability Management, and hardening
- 📑 **Evidence, Audits & Assurance**  
  Because *“show me the evidence”* is my comfort zone 😄

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Work With
- **GRC & Audit**: OneTrust, Excel (yes, advanced 😅), Risk Registers  
- **Security Tools**: Qualys, SIEMs, Firewalls, WAFs  
- **Frameworks & Standards**:  
  `PCI DSS` • `ISO 27001` • `NIST CSF / RMF` • `COBIT` • `ITGC`  
- **Cloud & DevSecOps**: AWS, GCP, CI/CD security concepts  
- **Languages**: Python (automation & scripts), SQL (evidence & logs)

---

## 🧩 How I Think
✔️ Controls should **reduce risk**, not just pass audits  
✔️ Compliance without security is theatre 🎭  
✔️ Security without business context is chaos 🔥  
✔️ If it can’t be evidenced, it didn’t happen

---

## 📌 Current Focus
- 📚 Deepening expertise in **GRC & Cybersecurity Auditing**
- 🏗️ Implementing **PCI DSS from scratch**
- 🧠 Bridging the gap between **technical security & audit expectations**
- 🎯 Preparing for **high-impact global roles in security & compliance**

---

## 💬 Let’s Talk About
- PCI DSS nightmares & success stories 😄  
- ISO 27001 implementation pain points  
- Risk assessments that *actually* make sense  
- Moving from **manual compliance to security maturity**
